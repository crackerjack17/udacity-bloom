  <ol><li>You have a computer</li>
      <li>You type a URL into a browser</li>
    <li>An <em>HTTP</em> request is sent to the corresponding server</li>
    <li>The server finds the page or document and sends it back to the requesting computer</li>
    <li>The user views the results (page/document) which is interpreted and displayed in a browser</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>HTML</h2>
  <br>
    HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em> also referred to as Hypertext Transfer Protocol. HTML documents form the majority of the content on the web. HTML documents contain <em>text content</em> which describes "what you see" and <em>markup</em> which describes "how it looks".
    <br>
    <h2>Tags and Elements</h2>
    <br>HTML is made up of elements that contain tags.  The tags define the element.
    <br>
    <h2>Computers are only as smart as the person behind the curtain</h2>
    <br>
    Computers only function because a person has written, or coded, a program to make them work.  When you make a mistake in your code, the computer will let you know it!
    <br>
    <h2>Inline vs. Block Elements</h2>
    <br>
    HTML elements are either <b>Inline</b> or <b>Block</b>. Block level elements normally start (and end) with a new line, when displayed in a browser.  Inline elements are normally displayed without line breaks.
